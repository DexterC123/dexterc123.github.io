    <h2>What am I doing?</h2>
    <p>I am going to be producing a Bus advert, Tube advert and a Motion Graphic 20 second video. All of these are going to help "galvanise 16 to 24 year olds across the world to stand up for their right to protect themselves"
and to "make carrying, and using, a condom the norm. Just like making a cup of tea or brushing your teeth."

<p>From the examples above, there is a clear style which these adverts take. They are filled with puns, symbolisms and are all in a similar style. There is something quite sly and cheeky about the posters too. However these posters don't really dive into much of the issues of unprotected sex, other than pregenency.
   There is a plethora of issues, from STIs, or cultural barriers that could be explored but on the whole aren't explored.</p>
   <p>In terms of Tube adverts, Durex hasn't made anything for the London Underground, nor have they made an advert specifically for a bus.
      I feel that producing these two things won't be too difficult, as the ideas I have in mind could easily work on a bus and tube advert.

<p>Im also going to be making a 20 second motion graphics video, there are a few motion graphic/animation adverts produced by durex and I'm going to try and create one in a similar style.
  Im thinking something bold and colourful, and something that will connect to the

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Section 1: Rationale</p>

<p>When I started out at BRIT I was only confident with Photoshop, and had only really used MS Paint at my old school as means for digital design where spread thin. However, this didn’t mean I wasn’t fully prepared for the choice I made coming here. I started this course with the mindset of ‘try everything and see what I enjoy most’, and after a few months of constant experimentation I found that I enjoy the more graphic side of things, as well as animation and some 3D. Through the course of my Motion Graphics I gained the most in terms of technical skills, and had the most fun. I learned new softwares like After Effects, MAYA, and Illustrator, and became more skilled at photoshop as well as drawing on iPads with Apple Pencils. All of these skills are what allowed me to build a liking to more graphic and artsy work. I knew a fraction of what I now know from 7 units of fun and challenging units, and I feel prepared and excited for the challenge I have ahead, and I know I will finish this project with more knowledge than I started with.
The reason why I chose the Durex advert was because I feel I will do the best I can with this brief, and my skill set matches the tasks requirements the most.
</p>
<p>Section 2: Project Concept</p>
<p>
After a lot of constant brainstorming, and a lot of thinking of which brief would be most suited to me, I chose the Durex brief due to my skill set being ideal for a brief which is mostly comprised of graphic/ motion graphic tasks. Also, I am passionate about the preservation of health of the youth, being a 16 year old myself I have more of a connection to a brief of this type. I feel I will do this brief the most justice. I have decided to make a Bus advert, Tube advert and a 20-second motion graphics video. I am really looking forward to designing something and then editing it into a real life situation, I’d like to see how my skills would look when implemented into a real life situation.
The main message I’d like to get across is to make wearing condoms the norm, and to spread a social norm for carrying condoms. I would also like young people to stand up for their right to protect themselves. I feel this is very important as generally wearing condoms will prevent all negatives that can arise with unprotected sex, I don’t want to focus on specific issues such as STIs or unwanted pregnancy, instead I want all of these issues dismissed by a widespread change for more (if not all) 16-24 year olds to wear condoms.
I’m going to achieve this by using bold and bright colours, short simple and hopefully catchy text, simplistic design work and graphics suitable for the 16-24 demographic. Also, to fully achieve my goal I’m going to need to make use of softwares such as Photoshop, and Illustrator, and also After Effects for the animation. Lastly, the main thing that will make my project a success is going to be the time and effort I put into it.
