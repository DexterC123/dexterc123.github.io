    <h2>What am I doing?</h2>
    <p>I am going to be producing a Bus advert, Tube advert and a Motion Graphic 20 second video. All of these are going to help "galvanise 16 to 24 year olds across the world to stand up for their right to protect themselves"
and to "make carrying, and using, a condom the norm. Just like making a cup of tea or brushing your teeth."
</p>

<p>From the examples above, there is a clear style which these adverts take. They are filled with puns, symbolisms and are all in a similar style. There is something quite sly and cheeky about the posters too. However these posters don't really dive into much of the issues of unprotected sex, other than pregenency.
   There is a plethora of issues, from STIs, or cultural barriers that could be explored but on the whole aren't explored.</p>
   <p>In terms of Tube adverts, Durex hasn't made anything for the London Underground, nor have they made an advert specifically for a bus.
      I feel that producing these two things won't be too difficult, as the ideas I have in mind could easily work on a bus and tube advert.
   </p>
<p>Im also going to be making a 20 second motion graphics video, there are a few motion graphic/animation adverts produced by durex and I'm going to try and create one in a similar style.
  Im thinking something bold and colourful, and something that will connect to the target audience.

<h2>Context</h2>
<div id="demobox">
<p2>Section 1: Rationale</p2>
</div>


<p>When I started out at BRIT I was only partially confident with Photoshop, and had only really used MS Paint at my old school, as software for digital design where spread thin. However, this didn’t mean I wasn’t fully prepared for the choice I made coming here. I started this course with the mindset of ‘try everything and see what I enjoy most’, and after a few months of constant experimentation I found that I enjoy the more graphic side of things, as well as animation and some 3D. Through the course of my Motion Graphics I gained the most in terms of technical skills, and had the most fun. I learned new softwares like After Effects, MAYA, and Illustrator, and became more skilled at photoshop as well as drawing on iPads with Apple Pencils. All of these skills are what allowed me to build a liking to more graphic and artsy work. I knew a fraction of what I now know from 7 units of fun and challenging units, and I feel prepared and excited for the challenge I have ahead, and I know I will finish this project with more knowledge than I started with.</p>

<p>The reason why I chose the Durex advert was because I feel I will do the best I can with this brief, and my skill set matches the tasks requirements the most. Im going to use my graphic/drawing skills as well as my photoshop skills to construct professional standard posters and animation.
</p>
<div id="demobox">
<p2>Section 2: Project Concept</p2>
</div>
<p>
After a lot of constant brainstorming, and a lot of thinking of which brief would be most suited to me, I chose the Durex brief due to my skill set being ideal for a brief which is mostly comprised of graphic/ motion graphic tasks. Also, I am passionate about the preservation of health of the youth, being a 16 year old myself I have more of a connection to a brief of this type. I feel I will do this brief the most justice. I have decided to make a Bus advert, Tube advert and a 20-second motion graphics video. I am really looking forward to designing something and then editing it into a real life situation, I’d like to see how my skills would look when implemented into a real life situation.
The main message I’d like to get across is to make wearing condoms the norm, and to spread a social norm for carrying condoms. I would also like young people to stand up for their right to protect themselves. I feel this is very important as generally wearing condoms will prevent all negatives that can arise with unprotected sex, I don’t want to focus on specific issues such as STIs or unwanted pregnancy, instead I want all of these issues dismissed by a widespread change for more (if not all) 16-24 year olds to wear condoms, I can highlight some of the issues, but overall I don't want the main aesthetic to be the harsh imagery that comes with STIs. </p>
<p>I’m going to achieve this by using bold and bright colours, short simple and hopefully catchy text, simplistic design work and graphics suitable for the 16-24 demographic. I am going to design my adverts in a light hearted and fun way, but I don't want to distract from the real issues that do exist. Also, to fully achieve my goal I’m going to need to make use of softwares such as Photoshop, and Illustrator, and also After Effects for the animation. Lastly, the main thing that will make my project a success is going to be the time and effort I put into it.

<p2>Section 3: How will you evaluate your work?</p2>
</div>
<p>I will evaluate my work through peer assessment, both as an ongoing activity and also for a final assessment. I really like using peer assessment as I’m surrounded by people with their own unique opinions and insights on what I can do to improve my work. It is easy to do this for my final evaluation, and also for any work that I need an extra mind to find the best outcome. I can also ask my teachers for any advice on things, this is usually very helpful.</p>

  <p>To complete this project within the time period I will be setting reminders on my calender on my phone, with all the dates for all the deadlines for the set tasks, such as the dates for when my planning should be done. I will also aim to complete tasks as early as possible, so I have the most amount of time to go back over my work and change it for the better. I am going to balance ambition, time and realsim by planning and being very aware of deadlines, hopefully this will allow me to spend as much time working an assessing my position.</p>
